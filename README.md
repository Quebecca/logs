VerteXVaaR.Logs
===============

## Introduction

Finally a backend module to read from the TYPO3 logging API.

Notice: Currently only log tables are supported for reading.
If you need a special log reader (e.g. file or syslog) feel free
to contact me or create a pull request with your proposal ;)

## Basic Usage

Relax and install via composer:

CLI walkthrough:

```
composer require vertexvaar/logs
```

Activate cia CLI or Extension Manager.

Other way (EM):

You should really use composer, just sayin'. But you can still install the extensions via the TYPO3 extension manager.
Don't forget to activate it afterwards.

Last way (DL):

If you don't want to do cool stuff with composer you can download this extension as ZIP.

## In depth

The logging API exists for a long time, but there is no nice way to read
those logs if the user has no direct access to the database or files.

Backend module created - problem solved!

The ConjunctionReader creates an instance of `Reader` for each `Writer`,
which reads from the specific location where the writer writes the log
entries. Therefore it's possible to read and filter logs accross all log
destinations (tables, files, etc.)

## TYPO3 & PHP compatibility

PHP 5.6 support has ended with the year 2018 and TYPO3 v7 LTS has ended also in that year. There is no point in supporting those two anymore.
As of 2019 and version 2.0 of this extension it requires/supports PHP 7.0 and TYPO3 v8 / v9.

## TODO

* Register as devlog
* ~~Also read from sys_log (maybe some adapter thingy?)~~
* Ensure log sources are processed only once
* Identify and fix that one bug that sometimes won't delete a log entry
* ~~Save the current filter in the user data so it still applies after reopening the module or deletion of an entry~~
* Add a log writer filter (to deselect log readers/erasers) #4
